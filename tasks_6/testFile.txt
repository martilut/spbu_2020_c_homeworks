Venom of Venus take us all for blind
Bringer of poison for the heart and mind
Never resist when your eyes inflame the wild
Venom of Venus or a fairytale
Sing of temptation when sirens wail
Out of our minds by the wonders you unveil
Come blessed desire bring us all to fail
We are the cursed we came from fire and ice
We are the first to kill the sinner for lies
We are the blessed, we crave the venom of Venus for life
All our life
We are the sword we tame the fire, the flame
We hail the lord we fear no rebel, no pain
We are possessed we have the venom of Venus in veins
Venom of Venus inundate our veins
Eradicate minds til only lust remains
Set us ablaze like the wake of hurricanes
Venom of Venus lead us all astray
Bring us the sin before the martyrs pray
Let it begin by the dawn of our judgement day
We are the cursed we came from fire and ice
We are the first to kill the sinner for lies
We are the blessed, we crave the venom of Venus for life
All our life
We are the sword we tame the fire, the flame
We hail the lord we fear no rebel, no pain
We are possessed we have the venom of Venus in veins
And in the eye of all the believing
Lead us straight to the curse divine
And by the time our hearts are healing
Inject the poison in our minds
We are the cursed we came from fire and ice
We are the first to kill the sinner for lies
We are the blessed, we crave the venom of Venus for life
We are the sword we tame the fire, the flame
We hail the lord we fear no rebel, no pain
We are possessed we have the venom of Venus in veins
